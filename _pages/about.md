Hi, my name is Qiang Zhang, a Postdoctoral research fellow in the Advanced Rehabilitation Research Training Projects (ARRTs) in the UNC/NCSU Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. I will be joining the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alabama in 08/2023 as a tenure-track assistant professor. 

Prior to the postdoctoral training, I got my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from the same institute in 2021, two Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Wuhan University in 2017 and the University of Pittsburgh in 2019, and Bachalor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wuhan University in 2014.

My research is in the areas of biological signal-based neuromusculoskeletal modeling, control of rehabilitative/assistive robotic exoskeletons and functional electrical stimulation, human-robot interaction, human motion intent prediction, neuromuscular signals processing (surface electromyography and ultrasound US imaging), human locomotion biomechanics, Lyapunov-based nonlinear control and adaptive control, machine learning-based control, linear/nonlinear observer design, sensor fusion, and their applications to wearable robotic devicesâ€™ control and next-generation healthcare.
